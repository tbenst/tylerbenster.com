    <h1 id="hi-im-tyler.">Hi, I’m Tyler.</h1>
<p>I’m a Neuroscience PhD candidate at Stanford, where I’m co-advised by <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/dlab/about_pi.html">Karl Deisseroth</a> and <a href="https://www.janelia.org/people/shaul-druckmann">Shaul Druckmann</a>. I also work as a General Partner at Asimov Ventures, an early-stage venture capital fund focused on Frontier Technology.</p>
<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<p>I was born in Palo Alto and grew up just outside of Seattle on beautiful Mercer Island. At a young age, captivated by shimmering vignettes of positronic brains and matter fabricators, I fell in love with science-fiction. Following the footsteps of Isaac Asimov’s protagonist Hari Seldon, I deemed myself a psychohistorian: a student of a fictional science combining psychology, history, economics, and mathematics to predict the course of future events.</p>
<p>Upon matriculation at Brown University, I approximated this field by concentrating in applied mathematics and economics. A few friends and I took a stab at matter fabrication with Azavy, a platform for distributed 3D printing. After tens of dollars in revenue, we shuttered the product and I became a consultant. I spent three years scouring the globe for the latest developments, and used my newfound knowledge to chair 3D Printing conferences in a dozen countries, and consult organizations like Lowe’s, HP, Stratasys, and the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office.</p>
<p>Yet once acquired, I found little purpose in this expertise <em>per se</em>. I came to realize that my greatest moments of joy and meaning were rooted in the act of discovering rather than that of knowing. As I surveyed the frontier, I conceived that Neuroscience and Neurotechnology would have the greatest impact on humanity during my lifetime. Thus, I joined Van Gelder Lab at UW Medicine to pursue research on vision restoration, and was humbled to join the Neuroscience PhD program at Stanford in Fall 2017.</p>
<p>Outside of Neuroscience and 3D printing, I love athletics – see my <a href="./best-times.html">best times</a>. In high school I was a Washington state record holder and All-America in swimming, and went on to score points at two Ivy League Championships. Halfway through college I switched to running. I helped set a school record (4x800m relay), placed third at the Ivy League Heptagonal championship (800m), and qualified for the NCAA Division 1 East Preliminary Round of the national championship (800M–1:49.72). More recently, I ran my first marathon and helped my sister to a Boston Marathon qualifying time (Go Lindsay!).</p>
