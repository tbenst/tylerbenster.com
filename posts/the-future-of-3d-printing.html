        <p><em>From Inside 3D Printing Seoul</em></p>
<p>Academics, economists and even politicians acknowledge the role of additive manufacturing in the Third Industrial Revolution. Yet most consumers did not buy a 3D printed good in 2014. Relying on case studies sourced from in-person visits to leading practitioners across more than 10 countries, this talk will dive into such discrepancies and offer a compelling perspective on the future of the technological and business landscape. Topics to be addressed include why the Long Tail is trumped by Constrained Customization, speculation on how to make 3DP 100x faster, and a definition of the ultimate promise of 3D printing.</p>
