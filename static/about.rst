I was born in Palo Alto and grew up just outside of Seattle on beautiful Mercer Island. I became an avid reader of Popular Science at age 12 and later fell in love with 3D printing after reading an article entitled [The Desktop Factory](http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2007-05/desktop-factory). In 2008, I became one of the first 350 people in the world to have a personal 3D printer when I built a RepRap Darwin from scratch: building the electronics by hand and sourcing the mechanical parts online.

I matriculated to Brown University where I concentrated in Applied Mathematics & Economics. In my senior year, a few friends and I launched Azavy. Azavy went on to [win the student track](http://www.risbj.com/designing-a-path-to-the-future-of-manufacturing/) of the Rhode Island Business Plan competition, was the top awardee at [Brown Venture Labs](http://brownentrepreneurship.com/venturelab/) and led to my participation in [Stanford E-Bootcamp](http://bases.stanford.edu/e-bootcamp/). More recently, I was one of three inaugural [Maker Fellows at Betaspring](http://www.betaspring.com/blog/2013/10/03/meet-new-betaspring-makers). I am currently the program chair of [Inside 3D Printing](http://www.mediabistro.com/inside3dprinting/), the largest industry tradeshow in the world.

Outside of 3D printing, I love athletics â€“ see my [best times](/best-times). In high school I was a Washington state record holder and All-America in swimming, and went on to score points at two Ivy League Championships. Halfway through college I switched to running. I helped set a school record (4x800m relay) and placed fourth  at the Ivy League Heptagonal championship (800m).
